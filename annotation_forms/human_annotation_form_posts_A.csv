Q09,"My mother(f51) is giving me(f17)the silent treatment and I don't know what to do.

Hello everyone. We are on a family vacation travelling home when we pop into a gas station for a little brake and to eat something because my father and I are hungry. My mother has told us that she doesn't want anything to eat or drink already. So we go to order while my mothers waiting at a table for us.bit when we get back she gets all frustrated about how no one asked her if she wanted anything to eat or drink. We tell her that she can eat from the pizza which we ordered a bigger size so we all can eat. She wasn't happy with that and stormed off without saying a word to me or my father. That's was around 1pm now it's 7mp and she hasn't talked to me since. 

I have tried to talk to her but she only answers with ""yes"" and ""no"" or nothing. What should I do? 


TL;DR: I(f18) am getting the silent treatment from my mother (f51) over a misunderstanding. She won't talk to me even if I try to start a small talk. What should I do?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1n44l9p/my_motherf51_is_giving_mef17the_silent_treatment/,Reddit,Reddit,Text-only,3.0,"My mother(f51) is giving me(f17)the silent treatment and I don't know what to do.
