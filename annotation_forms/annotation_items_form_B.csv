This is a long one so read at your own risk, maybe. A few days ago, I saw a post on here and it had a subject line I related to on so many levels. He‚Äôd articulated what I was feeling and my situation to a tee. It felt like he was writing as me. Topic: To Everyone Else Wearing A Mask. What he wrote resonated. It makes me wish he didn‚Äôt delete his account but that‚Äôs not the point. That post was the catalyst. It was a reminder that I am done putting up appearances. I",,,Reddit,offmychest,Text-only,3

Its tough taking a break when you have a goal you need to accomplish, but rest is essential. Don't ever underestimate the magic that is happening under the hood that is your skull (especially during rest) 
Careful not to ware yourself out before you get to your finish line. Listen closely to your quietest needs.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for about 1.5 years. I really love her a lot, but in the last 6 months our relationship feels stuck in a cycle of conflict and mistrust, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.
