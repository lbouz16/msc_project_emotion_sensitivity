3,1,Reddit,Text-only,relationships,"Feeling hopeless in my relationship

Hi all. My boyfriend who is 24M, and I 20F, have been together for a year and 5 months. He works full time from 11 AM to 8 PM and takes two online classes. I am in school full time and work only part time. We were long distance for around a year and have had a generally good relationship with a lot of ups and downs.

For many reasons we ultimately decided to move in together and have been sharing an apartment since July. Things were going pretty well until the other week, when we had a huge falling out.

(For context he works full time with shifts from 11 AM to 8 PM, so we really don’t get much time together aside from his days off). Recently there was a period where he had done something that bothered me, and at the same time was not doing enough effort wise (planning dates, spending more quality time with me), and so I attempted to talk to him about each of these things one after another. Because of work, and while he is also doing part time school at the same time, talking everything out spanned out over several days during nights after he got home. 

I get he is likely not looking forward to talking about our relationship every night for several nights after long shifts, but they were important conversations for the overall  health of our relationship,, and this was also the first time for this ever happening. It was not a recurring event.

The last night where we had finally talked about the final thing, I brought up how I was hurt about something he had done the night before, and how I wished he wouldn’t do that/put more effort towards being mindful of me,, such and such. And it was at this point that he blew up and told me “it’s just one thing after another,“ and that he was too overwhelmed. Despite trying to talk to him, he proceeded to literally ignore me in our own home for the next two days. The second night, I had to practically beg him to work things out with me, as he didn’t even care. In fact, he was mean, and mad. He has never treated me with such disrespect and little care, and I’m the most hurt I’ve ever been.

Throughout all of this, I tried to be very open hearted and was just genuinely looking to communicate with him healthily. I was never attacking towards him, rude or demeaning etc. So I cannot understand why he would be so cold to me.

We ended up “talking things out” (because I was crying to him for him to just talk to me), and ever since things haven’t been the same. Any time I would seem even the slightest upset with him, (which I haven’t even really expressed much at all since his freak out) he’d get irritated or pissed off. I feel like I can never talk to him about anything again. On top of this, he’s started to just ignore me whenever there’s a hint of an argument.

It had gotten so bad to the point that I was sobbing to my mom and seeking every option to move out. My anxiety has never been so bad, it was at the point where I was starving but couldn’t eat. He has never treated me so awfully and it’s been causing my mental health to deteriorate, considering I am stuck in a living space with him.

I finally decided to ignore him back (the most recent instance where he was ignoring me) and after about 2 days he finally talked to me and asked what we were doing. Long story short, as I was whole heartedly ready to walk out, I told him he needs therapy if he wants to continue this relationship. (For more context, I am getting therapy of my own, but for other reasons). He ultimately agreed but our relationship is still not the same as it was before.

I have not bothered talking to him about anything emotional or relationship related since. I am too scared of the outcome, and I’m not sure if this is the reason why he hasn’t ignored me again yet. However, I feel horrible. He doesn’t seem to care about me the same, care about our relationship the same, or even love me the same. He does still seem to care somewhat, but the effort he put in before now seems gone. He doesn’t really care to spend quality time with me as much any more. Only if there’s time for it. He hasn’t attempted to plan any dates despite me clearly having asked him.

We unknowingly both got a day off on the same day that I was excited to spend with him, and he spent the whole day building his new desk and not talking to me ONCE. I finally got in bed and went to sleep despite waiting for him all day.

He doesn’t send me sweet messages to have a good day at school/work anymore, and he overall puts practically no effort in making me feel special or feel like a girlfriend even. I feel so miserable, alone, sad and trapped. I have never felt such a horrible loneliness and unwanted feeling. I don’t know what to do

What can I do? I’m not sure if this relationship is even salvageable. Feeling hopeless and heartbroken.

TL;DR feels like boyfriends feelings towards me have changed and he doesn’t care about me the same. Sad and need advice",,

I feel like the amount of Reddit posts you make about a partner has to be indicative of where your relationship is going in and of itself.

So, my girlfriend (23F) and I (24M) have been seeing each other since March. I’ve known her since early 2024, and we had been seeing each other for a few months in the spring last year which ultimately ended, against my wishes. 

I absolutely love her, but I know for a fact that she’s not nearly as in to me. We both work full time jobs in cities 2 hours apart and I see her maybe twice a month if I’m lucky, and I’ll mostly do the travelling. 

She has no real interest in video calls with me and just basically texts. She never really plans anything and we have often had 3 week gaps where we don’t see each other. I haven’t had her over at mine in over a month (and I live in the better city for transport/date nights). 

I have been trying to communicate with her that I need more from her (some reassurance considering the big gaps, compliments, video calls) and to be honest she never really promises anything. I have recently lost a family member earlier this summer and a family childhood friend tragically this month, and she’s never really checked in on me after each of these events. She has even admitted to not being there for me. 

Whenever I come over to hers, she’s often very tired from work so we have dinner out and then she will just want to lie on her bed on her phone for the evening so she can decompress - I often feel like a lemon sitting there, wanting to cuddle or have sex or talk during our precious time. We’ve also only had sex once since we finished college in May 

Jesus, this doesn’t sound great, does it? 
Of course I’m compiling all the bad times, but I have not felt this way about someone before, but I’m also not willing to stay with someone who doesn’t make me feel good about myself.

Is it time to move on?

tl;dr: gf doesn’t make plans, we never call, we see each other twice a month, we rarely have sex",,
3,3,Reddit,Text-only,relationships,"I think I’m in a toxic situation, but I really need an honest third party because I keep second guessing myself

TLDR: this might not be working but it feels like if I try hard enough it can?

I’ve (F25) been in a rocky relationship with (M31). It’s been 10 months of constant fighting, incredibly sweet moments, and amazing u know what. I recently started this list of things to do or not do or else it will result in an argument. 

When I read it back, it really feels like the bare minimum. 

I feel like I’m constantly questioning myself and if I’m even a good partner, but another side of me feels like I’m stuck in a constant state of fight or flight. He is so critical, I’m scared to plan dates. Every time I have he’s hated it, and we’ve ended up getting into an argument. I feel like I’m answering a lot of my own questions just typing this out.

His thing with me is I don’t consider him or anticipate him, while my thing is I want to communicate about it. I don’t know to be honest. 

I feel like a lot of his points are valid, and he says that me saying we aren’t right for each other is a cop out and just is showing that I don’t want to put in the effort to change for him. The thing is I do, I really care for him and I think he is an amazing person. We really do have a crazy connection.

Here is the list:

Call him every day

Try any new food place you find w him

Don’t put yourself in unsafe situations, it’s not about making a statement. You need to value yourself over what ever the fuck you’re trying to do or say. 

If he tell you he needs space he doesn’t really. He wants you to reach out and comfort him

Always always alwayssss offer him a bite of your food

Make sure that before one of you guys leaves for a trip. You are able to make time to have u know what before they leave even if ur in a fight",,
